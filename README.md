# Analyzing data for practice

## Description

This project analyzes three CSV datasets: population, climate change indicators, and world GDP. Each dataset offers valuable insights into global demographics, environmental trends, and economic performance.

### Datasets

1. **Population Dataset**: Provides demographic information including population counts, growth rates, and demographic breakdowns by region or country.
